# Lexical Analysis for VidLang DSL

## Theory and Implementation

### What is a Lexer?

A lexer (or lexical analyzer) is the first phase of a compiler or interpreter that converts a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens. These tokens are meaningful chunks of the input that the parser can work with more easily. In our DSL for video processing (VidLang), the lexer plays a crucial role in identifying language constructs like variables, operators, commands, and literals.

- Lexical Rules: 8 distinct token types (KEYWORD, COMMAND, IDENTIFIER, NUMBER, STRING, OPERATOR, DELIMITER, COMMENT)
- Syntactic Rules: Complex with multiple nesting levels and alternative structures
- Ambiguity: Potentially ambiguous, requiring disambiguation rules for operators

### State Machine Approach

The lexer implementation is inspired by Rob Pike's approach in Go's `text/template` package, which combines state and action into a single concept: a **state function**. This creates an elegant state machine where each state knows what comes next.

```go
type stateFn func(*lexer) stateFn
```

This pattern is deceptively simple but incredibly powerful. Each state function processes some portion of the input and then returns the next state function to call. The beauty of this approach is that it completely eliminates the traditional state enumeration and giant switch statements you typically see in lexers. Instead, the control flow is expressed directly in code, making the lexer both more readable and more maintainable.

I was particularly drawn to this approach because it aligns perfectly with Go's strengths. The language's first-class functions allow state functions to be passed around effortlessly, and Go's concurrency features make it easy to set up a producer-consumer relationship between the lexer and parser.

### Lexer Structure

Our lexer maintains several fields to track its progress through the input string:

```go
type lexer struct {
    input         string    // string being scanned
    start         int       // start position of this item
    pos           int       // current input position
    startLine     int       // start line
    line          int       // current line
    width         int       // width of last rune read from input
    items         chan item // channel of scanned items
    allowSelfStar bool      // whether `*` is a selfstar or not
    reachedEOF    bool      // whether EOF has been reached
}
```

Each field serves a specific purpose in the lexing process. The `input` holds the entire script being processed, while `start` and `pos` mark the beginning and current position of the token being scanned. I track both the `startLine` and current `line` to provide meaningful error messages - this was a lesson learned from earlier iterations where debugging was unnecessarily difficult without proper line information.

The `width` field might seem unnecessary at first, but it's crucial for correctly handling Unicode characters when backing up. Go's UTF-8 handling is excellent, but you need to track character widths explicitly when manipulating strings at the byte level.

The `items` channel is where the magic happens for concurrency. By sending tokens through a channel, the lexer can run independently from the parser, potentially improving performance for longer scripts.

I added the `allowSelfStar` flag to tackle a common ambiguity in the language - the `*` character can mean multiplication or self-reference depending on context. This field tracks that context as we lex. Similarly, `reachedEOF` helps prevent redundant EOF tokens and simplifies control flow.

The lexer communicates with the parser through a channel of items:

```go
type item struct {
    typ itemType
    val string
    pos  int
    line int
}
```

Each item encapsulates everything the parser needs to know about a token. The `typ` field identifies what kind of token it is, while `val` contains the actual text from the script. The `pos` and `line` fields are invaluable for error reporting, allowing for specific error messages like "Unexpected token at line 5, position 23."

I also added a custom String() method to make debugging more pleasant:

```go
func (i item) String() string {
    switch {
    case i.typ == itemEOF:
        return "EOF"
    case i.typ == itemError:
        return i.val
    case i.typ > itemCommand:
        return fmt.Sprintf("cmd: %s", i.val)
    case len(i.val) > 10:
        return fmt.Sprintf("%.10q...", i.val)
    }
    return fmt.Sprintf("%q", i.val)
}
```

This might seem like a small detail, but it made a world of difference during development. Being able to print meaningful representations of tokens directly saved countless hours of debugging. The method handles special cases like EOF separately and truncates long tokens to prevent log bloat.

### Token Types

The language defines various token types as constants:

```go
type itemType int

const (
    itemError itemType = iota
    itemEOF
    itemIdentifier
    itemVariable
    // ... many more token types
)
```

Using an integer enum like this for token types is clean and efficient, but I did find myself occasionally wishing for Go's enums to be more expressive. In particular, being able to group related token types would have been helpful. I worked around this by using comments and consistent ordering to group tokens conceptually - operators together, delimiters together, commands together, and so on.

I started with `itemError` and `itemEOF` as the first two types because they're special cases that require specific handling. Having them at fixed positions makes certain logic more straightforward. The rest of the types follow a logical grouping that mirrors the language's structure.

One interesting choice was separating `itemIdentifier` and `itemVariable`. Initially, I tried treating them identically, but the language has subtle semantic differences between the two that became easier to handle by distinguishing them at the lexical level.

### Running the Lexer

The lexer starts at a designated state function (`lexScript`) and continues executing state functions until it returns `nil`:

```go
func run(l *lexer) {
    for state := lexScript; state != nil {
        state = state(l)
    }
    close(l.items)
}
```

This function is deceptively simple but encapsulates the entire lexing process. It begins with the `lexScript` state function and continues executing whatever state function is returned until one returns `nil`, which signals completion (or an unrecoverable error). After that, it closes the items channel to inform the parser that no more tokens are coming.

I initially had error handling directly in this function, but found that it was cleaner to handle errors through the item channel itself. This approach provides more flexibility in how errors are reported and handled by the parser.

The function is designed to be run as a goroutine (hence being called from a `go` statement in the `lex` function), which enables concurrent lexing and parsing:

```go
func lex(input string) *lexer {
    l := &lexer{
        input:         input,
        items:         make(chan item),
        allowSelfStar: false,
    }
    go run(l)
    return l
}
```

### Main Lexing Function

The main state function, `lexScript`, identifies the next token in the input:

```go
func lexScript(l *lexer) stateFn {
    if l.reachedEOF {
        l.emit(itemEOF)
        return nil
    }

    // Skip whitespace
    for isSpace(l.peek()) {
        l.next()
        l.ignore()
    }

    r := l.next()
    switch {
    case r == eof:
        l.emit(itemEOF)
        return nil
    case r == '#':
        return lexComment
    case r == '"':
        return lexString
    case unicode.IsDigit(r):
        l.backup()
        return lexNumber
    case isAlphaNumeric(r):
        l.backup()
        return lexIdentifier
    }

    // Handle operators and delimiters
    if op, ok := runeKeywords[r]; ok {
        // Special handling for * and other contextual tokens
        if op == itemMult && l.allowSelfStar {
            op = itemSelfStar
        }
        // Update context for parsing
        if op == itemAssign || op == itemLeftBrace {
            l.allowSelfStar = true
        }
        if op == itemRightParen {
            l.allowSelfStar = false
        }
        l.emit(op)
        return lexScript
    }

    // Handle multi-rune operators
    w := string(r)
    p := l.next()
    if p == eof {
        l.emit(itemEOF)
        return nil
    }
    w += string(p)
    if op, ok := strOperators[w]; ok {
        l.emit(op)
        if op == itemDeclare {
            l.allowSelfStar = true
        }
        if op == itemPipe {
            l.allowSelfStar = false
        }
        return lexScript
    }

    return l.errorf("unexpected character %#U", r)
}
```

This is the workhorse of our lexer, responsible for dispatching to more specific lexing functions based on what it encounters. The function first checks if we've already seen an EOF to prevent redundant processing. Then it handles whitespace, which was surprisingly finicky - in early versions, I had bugs related to whitespace handling that were difficult to track down.

After that, it uses a switch statement to check for specific characters that trigger specialized lexing states. I arranged these in rough order of frequency to optimize performance slightly. The calls to `l.backup()` before returning certain state functions might seem odd, but they're necessary because we've already consumed a character with `l.next()` and some specialized lexers expect to see that first character.

The operator handling showcases the context-sensitivity of our lexer. The `*` token is particularly ambiguous - it can be either multiplication or a self-reference depending on context. The `allowSelfStar` flag tracks whether we're in a context where self-reference is valid. This contextual lexing was tricky to get right, but it makes the parser's job much simpler.

Multi-rune operators like `:=` and `|>` require special handling since they need to be recognized as single tokens. I initially tried using a more generic approach with prefix trees, but found that a simple string concatenation and map lookup was more than sufficient for our small set of operators.

If no known token pattern is matched, we call `errorf` to report an unexpected character error. This function both sends an error token through the channel and shuts down the lexer by returning `nil`.

### Specialized Lexing Functions

Different token types require specialized handling:

#### Comments

```go
func lexComment(l *lexer) stateFn {
    for l.peek() == '#' {
        l.next()
        l.ignore()
    }
    for {
        c := l.next()
        switch c {
        case '\n':
            l.emit(itemComment)
            return lexScript
        case eof:
            l.emit(itemComment)
            l.emit(itemEOF)
            return nil
        }
    }
}
```

Comments in VidLang are straightforward - they start with `#` and continue to the end of the line. This function first skips any additional `#` characters (allowing for multi-hash comments like `##` for documentation), then consumes everything until a newline or EOF.

I decided to emit comments as tokens rather than ignoring them entirely, which is useful for documentation tools that might want to extract comments. The function handles two termination cases: a newline (where we return to `lexScript`) or an EOF (where we emit both the comment token and an EOF token before terminating).

An interesting edge case is when a comment appears at the end of the file without a trailing newline. I struggled with this until I added specific handling for EOF within the comment lexer.

#### Identifiers

```go
func lexIdentifier(l *lexer) stateFn {
    var r rune
    for r = l.next(); isAlphaNumeric(r); {
        r = l.next()
    }
    l.backup()

    word := l.input[l.start:l.pos]

    // Check if it's a command
    if item, ok := commands[word]; ok {
        l.emit(item)
        return lexScript
    }

    // Special keywords
    switch word {
    case globalStream:
        l.emit(itemStream)
    default:
        l.emit(itemIdentifier)
    }
    if r == eof {
        l.emit(itemEOF)
        return nil
    }
    return lexScript
}
```

The identifier lexer handles variable names, commands, and keywords. It first accumulates alphanumeric characters, then checks if the resulting word is special in some way.

I initially used a single map for all keywords, but found that separating commands into their own map made the code more maintainable as I added new video processing commands. The command map lets us emit specific token types for each command, which helps the parser implement command-specific behavior.

The handling of `globalStream` as a special keyword was an interesting design choice. I debated whether to treat it as a built-in variable or a language keyword, eventually settling on the latter to make its special role in the language more explicit.

I also made sure to check for EOF after identifying the token, which prevents the lexer from unnecessarily returning to `lexScript` only to immediately encounter an EOF.

#### Numbers

```go
func lexNumber(l *lexer) stateFn {
    // Optional leading sign
    l.accept("+-")
    // Is it a number?
    digits := "0123456789"
    l.acceptRun(digits)

    // Decimal point?
    if l.accept(".") {
        l.acceptRun(digits)
    }

    l.emit(itemNumber)
    return lexScript
}
```

Number lexing is relatively straightforward, handling both integers and floating-point values. The `accept` and `acceptRun` helper functions are particularly useful here, making the code much cleaner than explicit character-by-character checking.

I consciously chose not to support scientific notation (e.g., `1.23e-4`) because it wasn't necessary for our video processing DSL. Adding such support would be a simple extension if needed later.

One subtlety is that I don't validate that there's at least one digit before or after the decimal point. This allows formats like `.5` and `5.`, which some languages reject. For our DSL, this flexibility seemed reasonable and natural.

#### Strings

```go
func lexString(l *lexer) stateFn {
    for {
        r := l.next()
        if r == eof {
            return l.errorf("unterminated string")
        }
        if r == '\\' {
            // Handle escape sequence
            r = l.next()
            if r == eof {
                return l.errorf("unterminated string escape")
            }
            continue
        }
        if r == '"' {
            break
        }
    }
    l.emit(itemString)
    return lexScript
}
```

String lexing requires careful handling of escape sequences. The function consumes characters until it finds a closing quote, handling backslash escapes along the way. If it encounters EOF before a closing quote, it reports an error.

I realized during implementation that proper handling of escape sequences is surprisingly tricky. The function currently just skips over the escaped character without validating it, which is fine for basic use but could be enhanced to verify that only valid escape sequences are used.

Another consideration was whether to interpret escape sequences during lexing (e.g., converting `\n` to a newline character) or leave that to the parser. I chose the latter approach for simplicity, though either would work well.

### Helper Functions

The lexer includes several helper functions:

```go
// emit sends an item back to the client
func (l *lexer) emit(t itemType) {
    l.items <- item{t, l.input[l.start:l.pos], l.start, l.startLine}
    l.start = l.pos
    l.startLine = l.line
}
```

The `emit` function is the bridge between the lexer and parser, sending a new token through the items channel. It's deceptively simple but does several important things at once: creating the token with the right type and value, resetting the start position to prepare for the next token, and updating the start line for error reporting.

```go
// next returns the next rune in the input
func (l *lexer) next() rune {
    if int(l.pos) >= len(l.input) {
        l.reachedEOF = true
        return eof
    }
    r, w := utf8.DecodeRuneInString(l.input[l.pos:])
    l.pos += w
    if r == '\n' {
        l.line++
    }
    return r
}
```

The `next` function is the heart of character-by-character lexing. It advances through the input, handling UTF-8 characters correctly (thanks to Go's built-in support), and tracking line numbers. The `reachedEOF` flag helps prevent infinite loops and redundant EOF tokens.

```go
// peek returns but does not consume the next rune
func (l *lexer) peek() rune {
    r := l.next()
    l.backup()
    return r
}
```

The `peek` function is a convenience that lets us look at the next character without consuming it. This is especially useful for lookahead operations like checking if a comment contains additional `#` characters.

```go
// backup steps back one rune
func (l *lexer) backup() {
    if l.pos > 0 {
        r, w := utf8.DecodeLastRuneInString(l.input[:l.pos])
        l.pos -= w
        // Correct newline count
        if r == '\n' {
            l.line--
        }
    }
}
```

The `backup` function is trickier than it first appears because we need to handle UTF-8 characters correctly. It steps back one character and adjusts the line count if necessary. Getting this right was essential for the lexer to work correctly with non-ASCII text.

```go
// accept consumes the next rune if it's from the valid set
func (l *lexer) accept(valid string) bool {
    if strings.ContainsRune(valid, l.next()) {
        return true
    }
    l.backup()
    return false
}

// acceptRun consumes a run of runes from the valid set
func (l *lexer) acceptRun(valid string) {
    for strings.ContainsRune(valid, l.next()) {
    }
    l.backup()
}
```

These convenience functions make the code much more readable when consuming characters that match certain patterns. The `accept` function handles optional characters (like the sign in a number), while `acceptRun` efficiently consumes repeated characters (like digits).

```go
// ignore skips over the pending input before this point
func (l *lexer) ignore() {
    l.line += strings.Count(l.input[l.start:l.pos], "\n")
    l.start = l.pos
    l.startLine = l.line
}
```

The `ignore` function is used to discard input that doesn't contribute to tokens, like whitespace. It's important that it correctly updates line counts for accurate error reporting. I initially missed this, which led to confusing error messages until I fixed it.

### Context Sensitivity

An interesting aspect of our lexer is its context sensitivity. For example, the `*` character can be interpreted either as a multiplication operator or as a "self-star" reference (similar to `this` in other languages) depending on the context:

```go
if op == itemMult && l.allowSelfStar {
    op = itemSelfStar
}
```

This context sensitivity was one of the trickier parts of the lexer to get right. The language's syntax allows `*` to mean multiplication in expressions like `0.5*i+1`, but it's also used for self-reference in contexts like `videoTrack =*`. Distinguishing between these uses requires tracking the syntactic context.

The `allowSelfStar` boolean is toggled based on specific tokens that change the context:

```go
if op == itemAssign || op == itemLeftBrace {
    l.allowSelfStar = true
}
if op == itemRightParen {
    l.allowSelfStar = false
}
```

This approach felt a bit hacky at first - I was essentially leaking parser knowledge into the lexer - but it actually worked really well in practice. The alternative would have been to make the parser disambiguate the `*` token based on context, which would have been more complex.

Similar context tracking is done for multi-rune operators:

```go
if op, ok := strOperators[w]; ok {
    l.emit(op)
    if op == itemDeclare {
        l.allowSelfStar = true
    }
    if op == itemPipe {
        l.allowSelfStar = false
    }
    return lexScript
}
```

The `:=` declaration operator and `|>` pipe operator also affect whether `*` should be interpreted as self-reference. This pattern of tracking context through state worked well, though it did require careful thought about how each operator affects the syntax.

## Code Example and Output

Let's examine how the lexer processes a simple VidLang script:

```go
func main() {
    testScript := `
#!/bin/venv vidlang
videoTrack, audioTrack := open "video.mp4"
introVid, introAud := open "intro.mp4"
outro, outroAud := open "outro.mp4"
audioTrack |> volume 1.5
# stream is a global variable representing the latest pipeline result
audioTrack = [stream, *]
    |> crossfade 0.5
    |> pitch 1.5
videoTrack =*
    |> brightness 1.3
    |> contrast 1.1
sequence := [introAud, audioTrack, outroAud]
    |> map [i, el] ( el |> volume 0.5*i+1 )
trackline [intoVid, videoTrack, outro] sequence
export "final.mp4"
`
    l := lex(testScript)
    for {
        item := <-l.items
        if item.typ == itemEOF {
            break
        }
        fmt.Printf("%#v\n", item)
        if item.typ == itemError {
            os.Exit(1)
        }
    }
}
```

This script demonstrates many of the language features: variable declarations, function calls, pipelines, self-references, and comments. The lexer breaks it down into a stream of tokens that the parser can then assemble into a meaningful program.

When running this example, you'll see each token printed with its type, value, and position information. This output is invaluable for debugging the lexer itself and understanding how the language is interpreted.

I deliberately chose a script that exercises most of the interesting parts of the lexer, especially the context-sensitive handling of the `*` token. Looking at a complex script like this helped me catch several edge cases during development.

## Design Considerations

### Channel-Based Communication

The lexer communicates with its consumer through a channel, enabling concurrent operation. This is particularly useful for a language processing video streams, where parallelism is beneficial:

```go
func lex(input string) *lexer {
    l := &lexer{
        input:         input,
        items:         make(chan item),
        allowSelfStar: false,
    }
    go run(l)
    return l
}
```

Using a channel for communication is one of my favorite aspects of this design. It neatly decouples the lexer from its consumer (usually the parser) and allows them to work concurrently. The lexer can be scanning ahead while the parser is still processing earlier tokens, which should improve performance for larger scripts.

This approach leverages Go's goroutines and channels to create a natural producer-consumer relationship. The lexer produces tokens and sends them through the channel, while the parser consumes them at its own pace. The channel acts as a buffer, smoothing out any speed differences between the two.

One limitation is that the channel has no built-in backpressure mechanism - if the lexer runs much faster than the parser, it could potentially build up a large number of tokens in memory. In practice, this hasn't been an issue, but it's something to be aware of.

### Error Handling

The lexer includes robust error handling with detailed position information:

```go
func (l *lexer) errorf(format string, args ...any) stateFn {
    l.items <- item{itemError, fmt.Sprintf(format, args...), l.start, l.startLine}
    l.start = 0
    l.pos = 0
    l.input = l.input[:0]
    return nil
}
```

Error handling was a priority from the beginning. The `errorf` function does three important things: it sends an error token with a formatted message through the channel, resets the lexer state to prevent further lexing, and returns `nil` to terminate the lexing process.

I initially had a more complex error handling system that tried to recover from errors and continue lexing, but found that it often just led to cascading errors that were harder to debug. The current approach of stopping at the first error and providing a clear message proved more practical.

Including the position information (line and character position) in the error token made a huge difference in usability. It allows the parser or other tools to generate user-friendly error messages like "Unexpected character '?' at line 5, position 23" rather than just "Syntax error."

### Operator and Command Recognition

The lexer uses maps to efficiently recognize operators and commands:

```go
var runeKeywords = map[rune]itemType{
    '(':  itemLeftParen,
    ')':  itemRightParen,
    ',':  itemComma,
    '[':  itemLeftBrace,
    ']':  itemRightBrace,
    '\n': itemNewline,

    '_': itemUnderscore,

    '*': itemMult,
    '+': itemPlus,
    '-': itemMinus,
    '/': itemDiv,
    '=': itemAssign,
}

var strOperators = map[string]itemType{
    ":=": itemDeclare,
    "|>": itemPipe,
    "..": itemConcatOp,
}

var commands = map[string]itemType{
    "brightness": itemBrigtness,
    "concat":     itemConcat,
    "contrast":   itemContrast,
    "crossfade":  itemCrossfade,
    "cut":        itemCut,
    "fade":       itemFade,
    "hue":        itemHue,
    "map":        itemMap,
    "open":       itemOpen,
    "pitch":      itemPitch,
    "saturation": itemSaturation,
    "speed":      itemSpeed,
    "trackline":  itemTrackLine,
    "volume":     itemVolume,
}
```

Using maps for lookups is both efficient and maintainable. It's easy to add new operators or commands just by adding entries to these maps, without modifying the core lexing logic.

I separated single-rune operators, multi-rune operators, and commands into different maps for clarity. This separation reflects the different ways these elements are detected in the lexer. Single-rune operators can be identified with a simple lookup after reading one character, while multi-rune operators require reading two characters and checking a different map.

The command map serves as both a lookup table and a validation mechanism - if a word exists in the commands map, it's a valid command. This allowed me to add helper functions like `isCommand()` that simplified command detection:

```go
func isCommand(s string) bool {
    _, ok := commands[s]
    return ok
}
```

Similarly for multi-rune operators:

```go
func isStrOperator(s string) bool {
    _, ok := strOperators[s]
    return ok
}
```

These helper functions made the code more readable in places where I just needed to check if something was a command or operator without caring about the specific type.

## Conclusion

The lexer implementation for our VidLang DSL demonstrates several important principles of lexical analysis:

1. **State-Based Design**: Using state functions creates a clean, maintainable state machine without the need for explicit state enumerations or complex switch statements.

2. **Context Sensitivity**: The lexer can interpret tokens differently based on context, which makes the parser's job simpler by resolving ambiguities like the dual meaning of `*` at the lexical level.

3. **Concurrent Operation**: Channel-based communication enables parallel lexing and parsing, potentially improving performance for larger scripts.

4. **Robust Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with position information aid debugging and create a better experience for language users.

I found Rob Pike's state function approach to be remarkably elegant and well-suited to Go's strengths. The resulting lexer is concise, efficient, and easy to extend with new language features. Most importantly, it handles the complex rules of our video processing DSL while providing clear error messages when things go wrong.

The lexer forms the foundation of our VidLang compiler, converting raw text into a stream of tokens that the parser can assemble into meaningful operations. The next step would be implementing the parser, which will transform these tokens into an abstract syntax tree representing the structure and semantics of the program.

One thing I've learned through this implementation is that seemingly small design decisions in the lexer can have significant impacts on the overall language experience. By carefully designing the token types and lexing rules, we've created a foundation that makes the rest of the compiler simpler and more robust.
